**D**eep learning of **MOViE** files for **M**anagement of **EN**dovascular **T**hrombectomy


Treatment and outcomes of acute stroke have been revolutionised by mechanical thrombectomy. Deep learning has shown great promise in diagnostics but applications in interventional radiology lag behind. We developed a model by that takes as an input digital subtraction angiography (DSA) videos of the anterior cerebral circulation and subsequently classifies the video according to: (1) the presence or absence of large vessel occlusion (LVO), (2) the location of the occlusion and (3) the efficacy of reperfusion.


To reproduce our work, please see the Jupyter notebook DeepMovement.ipynb. A video illustrating the attention of the stacked-Xception model is captured on various occlusion types:
