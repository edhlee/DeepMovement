**D**eep learning of **MOViE** files for **M**anagement of **EN**dovascular **T**hrombectomy

Treatment and outcomes of acute stroke have been revolutionised by mechanical thrombectomy. Deep learning has shown great promise in diagnostics but applications in interventional radiology lag behind. We developed a model by that takes as an input digital subtraction angiography (DSA) videos of the anterior cerebral circulation and subsequently classifies the video according to: (1) the presence or absence of large vessel occlusion (LVO), (2) the location of the occlusion and (3) the efficacy of reperfusion.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12375462/161031372-3362d0d8-7e5d-4e53-8827-ff4efe913213.png)

To reproduce our work, please see the Jupyter notebook DeepMovement.ipynb. A video illustrating the attention of the stacked-Xception model is captured on various occlusion types:
